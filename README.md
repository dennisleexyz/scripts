My shell scripts for system automation
======================================
Mostly POSIX *sh*(1) scripts. Some use GNU *bash*(1) features and are
shebanged accordingly.

Each script should contain its own documentation, but some of it might
be lacking.

Some scripts might not work correctly, either because of edge cases or
because I wrote the commands to the script after using them
interactively and the logic might not hold up. If this is the case, let
me know!
